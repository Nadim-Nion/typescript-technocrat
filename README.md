# TypeScript Technocrat

Welcome to **TypeScript Technocrat**! This repository documents my learning journey through TypeScript, covering everything from foundational type systems to advanced concepts and object-oriented programming. Whether you're new to TypeScript or looking to deepen your understanding, this project showcases core TypeScript principles, practical applications, and coding examples for each topic.

---

## Key Topics Covered

### 1. **Basic Types**
   - **Primitive Types**: Mastering the essentials of TypeScript’s built-in types, including `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, and `any`.
   - **Arrays & Tuples**: Learning to work with collections and fixed-structure data sets, using array and tuple types for predictable code.
   - **Enums**: Understanding enumerations to represent constant values more intuitively.
   - **Type Assertions**: Exploring ways to explicitly set types in scenarios where TypeScript’s inference needs guidance.

### 2. **Advanced Types**
   - **Union & Intersection Types**: Using unions to combine multiple types and intersections to merge different types, creating more flexible structures.
   - **Type Aliases & Interfaces**: Structuring code with aliases for complex types and defining interfaces for reusable object shapes.
   - **Literal Types & Type Guards**: Leveraging literal types for precise value matching and type guards to safely handle types at runtime.
   - **Generics**: Implementing generic types to build reusable and type-safe components, functions, and classes that work with various data types.
   - **Mapped & Conditional Types**: Understanding mapped types to transform properties in object types and conditional types for conditional logic based on types.

### 3. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - **Classes & Inheritance**: Applying class-based design in TypeScript with a focus on creating objects and using inheritance to build extensible systems.
   - **Encapsulation**: Encapsulating properties and methods to manage access and safeguard internal states.
   - **Polymorphism**: Implementing polymorphism through method overriding and interfaces, enabling flexible functionality and extension.
   - **Access Modifiers & Abstract Classes**: Using modifiers like `public`, `protected`, and `private` for class properties and methods, and leveraging abstract classes for shared behavior without instantiation.

### Project Highlights
   - **Practical Code Examples**: Real-world examples and exercises are included for each topic, demonstrating how to apply TypeScript concepts in a variety of scenarios.
   - **Best Practices**: Emphasis on best practices for clean, maintainable, and scalable TypeScript code.
   - **Documentation & Comments**: Comprehensive explanations and comments for each example to guide through each concept’s usage and benefits.
